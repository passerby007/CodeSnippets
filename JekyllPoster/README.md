# Jekyll Poster

A tool to help myself to quickly generate a new Jekyll post.

  * It contains a QT based user interface
  * The actual function is done in a Python script (gen_poster.py)
  * The Python script can run independently
  * It works together with the Atom editor and GitHub for Mac by default,
    but it's totally configurable.
  * The tool chain looks like this: Alfred->JekyllPoster->Atom->GitHub
  * It's currently built and working on Max OS X only
